- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @julas23 - Juliano Alves dos Santos
I am sharing here my conky layout, totally free and ready to use.
Actually the wheather widget is running a Brazillian institute to fill up the content.
For next versions I will try to update using some global resource to be compatible with everyone in the globe.


For now, the best way to use this template, is cloning and running the script. Follow the steps below:

```shell
$ cd /opt/
$ git clone https://github.com/julas23/Conky.git
$ cd conky
$ chmod +x myconky
$ ./myconky pre
```

This will install all pre requisites and configure all the resources necessary to use this template/layout.


Enjoy
