- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @julas23 - Juliano Alves dos Santos
I am sharing here my conky layout, totally free and ready to use.
Actually the wheather widget is running a Brazillian institute to fill up the content.
For next versions, I will try to update using some global resource, to be compatible with everyone in the world.


For now, the best way to use this template, is cloning and running the script. Follow the steps below:

```shell
$ cd /opt/
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/julas23/Conky.git
$ sudo apt install -y screenfetch cal ncal lm-sensors psensor gcalcli conky-all hwinfo
$ cd conky
$ sudo chmod +x myconky
$ myconky
```

This will install all pre requisites and configure all the resources necessary to use this template/layout.
Follow below the parameters and objectives for each one:

"pre" # preparation
"use" # user-host
"dis" # distro
"ker" # kernel
"upt" # uptime
"pac" # packages
"she" # shell
"res" # resolution
"env" # environment
"win" # myndow manager
"the" # theme
"cpu" # cpu model
"ctp" # cpu temperature
"cfr" # CPU fan rotation
"gpu" # gpu model
"gfr" # GPU fan rotation
"gtp" # gpu temperature
"mob" # MotherBoard model
"stp" # MoBo tmeperature
"mem" # memory
"cal" # calendar
"all" # full output

Enjoy
